Lots of hype on Bitcoin (BTC) and Crypto recently as it surges once against past all time high! Thanks to my very smart friends in the crypto space, I've started to research more and truly believe there's huge potential behind this technology.

If you're keen to get started or are new to this, I'd recommend to get some free crypto from crypto.com - while the promotion lasts!

## Crypto.com 'free' Spotify, Netflix and more!

Crypto.com provides lots of rewards and benefits (such as 'free' Spotify and Netflix) if you sign up with them and apply for one of its Visa card! Here's what you need to do, in summary:

1. Sign up for a crypto.com account using [this link](https://crypto.com/app/bmrv56k9ez) and referral code **bmrv56k9ez**.

2. Complete KYC

3. Sign up for at least Ruby Steel Visa card

4. Prove to customer support your Spotify (or Netflix) subscription

5. Collect your 'free' monthly rebates :)

<br />

## Instructions in more detail (with screenshots)

#### 1. Sign up for a crypto.com account

Sign up using this link (https://crypto.com/app/bmrv56k9ez) on your mobile phone and referral code **bmrv56k9ez**. This will get you USD$25 in CRO. (Note: CRO tokens is crypto.com's native token)

#### 2. Complete your KYC process

KYC stands for know-your-customer, where you'd be asked to submit a photo of your ID. This is is pretty much standard practice for identity verification (to prevent fraud).

#### 3. Sign up for the Ruby Steel Privileges (or higher tier) Visa card.

Note that you'll need to buy and stake SGD$500 worth of CRO for 180 days to get the Ruby Steel Visa card, so as to get the Spotify rebate benefits.

If it's your first time buying CRO, perhaps the easiest way to do that is to go to the _App main menu -> Buy -> Crypto.com coin_. Here, you can select either [Credit Card (0% fees for first 30 days)](https://blog.crypto.com/0-credit-debit-card-fees-for-the-first-30-days/) or Fiat Wallet (set up a new Currency using Xfers to transfer SGD into the account).

If you're new to the concept of [staking](https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/1961286-how-do-i-stake-cro-on-the-crypto-com-app), you can think of it like a fixed deposit, where you need to buy and hold the CRO tokens in your crypto.com wallet for a period of 6 months (no selling or withdrawing). The SGD$500 will be subjected to the fluctuations of the value of the CRO tokens during the 6 months (with potential upside if CRO moons)!

Alternatively, apart from the Ruby Steel card, you can also choose the higher tier cards for more benefits (but you would need to stake more CRO. For example, if you stake SGD$5,000 for the Jade Green/Royal Indigo, you'll get 'free' Spotify + Netflix, as well as Airport Lounge access! [More info here](https://crypto.com/sg/cards):

#### 4. Prove to customer support your subscription(s)

Within the crypto.com app, you can easily chat with their customer support (which is super responsive) and show proof of subscription charges for Spotify (or Netflix if you qualify).

From the app's Main menu, click on the chat logo on the top right, and select _Send us a message_ -> _English_ -> _Crypto.com Visa Card_ and tell the agent you want to receive the Spotify (or Netflix's) Visa card rebates. They will probably ask you for proof of payment of the subscription, which I sent a bank statement as follows. Thankfully they only asked this once and not every month! :) Here's a screenshot (notice I blurred out confidential info).

#### 5. Collect your 'free' monthly rebates

Receive monthly cashback/rebates for your Spotify subscription (or Netflix if you qualify)! The reason why I'm saying _'free'_ is because you will receive the subscription rebates in the form of crypto.com's native token, CRO.

## What is CRO and what can you do with it?

CRO per time of writing this post, one CRO token is worth ~SGD$0.50. It has gone up almost 2x since i staked my SGD$500 for the Ruby card, which is now worth SGD$1,000. This made me regret not staking more for the higher tier cards :p

In any case, with CRO - you can sell any CRO (that is not staked) back to fiat (i.e. SGD), or you can use it to buy other cryptos, such as BTC, ETH, and many other coins on the crypto.com platform! You can also transfer CRO to other trading platforms which supports to buy other coins not available on the crypto.com platform.

If you have spare CRO, you can also deposit them into the Supercharger pool to earn rewards on other tokens as well! Good way to farm additional crypto for free!

## What about the Visa card?

You might ask - what about the Visa card? Well, it's really optional, in my opinion. It's a nice metal card to have which charges no annual fees. I don't use it much, but should you choose to use the card for your purchases, you also get rebates in the form of CRO depending on the tier of the card. The Ruby card (which you staked SGD$500 for) provides a 2% rebate. Note that the Visa card is a debit card, and you'll need to top up with SGD credits before you can use it to spend!

Hope this helps as you're getting started on your crypto journey! :)
